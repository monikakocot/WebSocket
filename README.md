WebSocker Chat made with Java and Javascript.

You can use it locally. I set it on port(s): 4242 (http).

1. For normal user just write your name as a first message. You cannot send empy message.
2. I you want to be admin write: "amanda" as a first message and password: "Ppassword". In this case:
- you can block some user by: "/mute nickOfUser" for 30 seconds 
- you can unblock somebody by: "/unmute nickOfUser" 
3. If you want to see last 10 messages write: "archiwum".
4. If you will send more than 15 messages through 1 minuted you will be ban or 1 minute.

I made this through Java Bootcamp with Akademia Kodu and i implements own functionalities.
